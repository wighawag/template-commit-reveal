	 * dead end - "your play key needs gas" with no way to act on it, while the one

	 * offers the faucet on its own when funds are short) was hidden behind the
	 * very gate that was complaining. Gas is shown in the HUD as information; it
	 * is not a gate.
	 *
	 * Authorisation IS a gate, and for the opposite reason: it is not a
	 * degradation but a hard stop. `makeCommitment` resolves the caller against
	 * the account's registered delegate and reverts with `NotDelegate` if they do
	 * not match, so without it a player can plan a whole turn, watch the commit
	 * fail, and have no idea why. Same principle as the stake gate: never invite
	 * a move that cannot be made.
	 *
	 * Ordered AFTER the stake, because acquiring one carries the authorisation
	 * with it. See `setupNeeded` for why that is the order that leaves a player
	 * who abandons setup half way having spent as little as possible.
